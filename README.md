## 🎨 Customization

### 1. Update Your Content (REQUIRED!)

Edit `resources/project_map.json` to personalize your portfolio:

```json
{
  "Earth": {
    "title": "Your Name — Portfolio",
    "short": "Full-stack developer passionate about 3D experiences",
    "long": "5+ years building interactive web applications with React, Three.js, and Node.js...",
    "image": "https://your-image-url.com/photo.jpg",
    "projects": [
      {
        "name": "Awesome Project",
        "description": "Built a real-time 3D collaboration platform",
        "tech": "React, Three.js, WebSockets, Node.js",
        "link": "https://github.com/yourusername/project"
      }
    ],
    "contact": {
      "email": "yourname@example.com",
      "phone": "+1 (555) 123-4567",
      "location": "San Francisco, CA"
    },
    "links": [
      { "label": "GitHub", "url": "https://github.com/yourusername" },
      { "label": "LinkedIn", "url": "https://linkedin.com/in/yourusername" },
      { "label": "Resume", "url": "https://your-resume-url.com" }
    ]
  },
  "Mercury": { ... },
  "Venus": { ... },
  "Mars": { ... },
  "Jupiter": { ... },
  "Saturn": { ... }
}
```

### 2. Adjust Settings (Optional)

In `main.js`, you can fine-tune performance:

```javascript
// Line 23-24: Control responsiveness (already optimized)
let spaceshipSpeed = 0.6; // Movement speed
let spaceshipRotationSpeed = 0.08; // Rotation speed (snappier)

// Line 35: Mouse sensitivity (increased for responsiveness)
let mouseLookSensitivity = 0.005;

// Line 28: Proximity detection
let proximityThreshold = 25; // Distance to detect planets

// Line 1204: Particle count (reduced for performance)
const particleCount = 25; // Trail particles
```

### 3. Customize Styles (Optional)

Edit CSS in `index.html` (lines 52-156) to change:

- Color schemes (search for `#06b6d4` to change accent color)
- Font family (currently `Inter, Roboto, Arial`)
- UI sizes and spacing
- Animation timings

---

- ✅ Control tests (WASD, mouse, keyboard)
- ✅ Visual effects (particles, glow, trails)
- ✅ Planet interactions (proximity, overlays)
- ✅ Audio tests (background music)
- ✅ Performance tests (FPS, memory)
- ✅ Mobile/responsive tests

### Quick Test

```bash
# Start local server
python -m http.server 8080

# Open http://localhost:8080
# Check browser console (F12) for errors
# Test spaceship movement (WASD)
# Test planet interaction (click or Space)
# Test overlay close (Escape)
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**❌ Spaceship/Planets not loading**

- Check browser console (F12) for errors
- Ensure `resources/` folder has all GLB files
- Verify you're running a local server (not opening file://)

**❌ Controls not working**

- Click on the canvas to focus
- Check JavaScript is enabled
- Try refreshing the page (Ctrl+Shift+R)

**❌ Performance issues/lag**

- Already optimized! But you can reduce `particleCount` in main.js (line 1204)
- Close other browser tabs
- Check GPU acceleration is enabled in browser settings

**❌ Planet overlay not showing**

- Check `project_map.json` is valid JSON (use [jsonlint.com](https://jsonlint.com))
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify planet names match the GLB model node names

**❌ Favicon 404 error**

- ✅ **Fixed!** `favicon.svg` is now included
